# 🛋️ 3D Interactive Room Scene with Couch & Lamp - Three.js Project

This project presents a **realistic 3D interactive scene** built with **Three.js** and **WebGL**, featuring a cozy room setup that includes a **texturable couch** and a **functional lamp**. The environment allows for immersive interaction and smooth visuals, optimized for performance and responsiveness.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This application demonstrates how to:
- Dynamically apply textures to 3D models.
- Create interactive light effects.
- Navigate a 3D scene using camera controls.
- Optimize rendering and texture memory handling in WebGL.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** JavaScript
- **Graphics Library:** [Three.js](https://threejs.org/)
- **Rendering Engine:** WebGL
- **Development Tools:** Visual Studio Code, Browser DevTools

## 🎮 Features

### ✅ 1. 3D Couch with Clickable Textures
- A fully textured couch model.
- Clicking on the couch cycles through a set of preloaded textures.
- Textures change in real-time, providing an interactive visual experience.

### ✅ 2. 3D Lamp Stand with Dynamic Lighting
- A detailed lamp model acts as a light source.
- Users can turn the lamp **on and off**.
- The light gradually dims or brightens to simulate real-life lamp behavior.

### ✅ 3. Smooth Camera Controls
- Explore the room using **mouse and keyboard controls**.
- Camera transitions are smooth for an immersive 3D experience.

### ✅ 4. Optimized Texture Management
- All textures are **preloaded** to avoid lag during runtime.
- Efficient memory usage ensures **smooth performance** across devices.
