# FallGuard
This project presents a real-time fall detection system
 leveraging a YOLO-based deep learning model on a Raspberry
 Pi. The system integrates computer vision techniques with sound
 and email alerts to detect human falls efficiently. The proposed
 solution is optimized for edge devices, ensuring minimal compu
tational overhead while maintaining high accuracy.
